Create engaging typing animations with typewriter, Matrix-style, and hybrid effects.

== Description ==

The Typing Effects block brings your text to life with three distinct animation styles:

* **Typewriter Effect**: Classic character-by-character typing animation with a blinking cursor
* **Matrix Shuffle**: Each character randomly shuffles through different letters before settling on the final character
* **Hybrid Mode**: Combines both effects for a unique typing experience with character shuffling

Perfect for:
- Landing pages and hero sections
- Code demonstrations and terminal simulations
- Creative storytelling and engaging content
- Adding dynamic elements to static text

The block includes customizable settings for typing speed, animation delays, and styling options to match your site's design.
